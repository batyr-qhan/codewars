This is a photo from the past and I'm here to shoot something of much greater importance. However, our mission is being compromised by terrible weather. #Follow me on @paulnicklen to see if we succeed this week or not. With this heavy rain we will definitely not be seeing the aurora borealis tonight. #challenge #nature #instaweather #smile #explore</a>
